                    Hey there! Thanks for checking out my portfolio page. I'm Hector, a quirky programmer with a passion for developing rich gameplay mechanics and ensuring innovative gaming experiences through a critical lens.

                    My focus tends to be in the realm of front-end web development, but I have a secret love interest with game graphics programming and low-level optimizations.

                    I spend my free time composing music, dabbling in pixel art, and studying Japanese &mdash; oh, and I seem to have this weird fascination for math!

                    <p>
                    Lately, I've tried to recruit friends for game jams/hackathons with me to try out new tech for expanding my horizons. It's a fast-growing industry and it's imperative to stay on your A game!
