We also used a computer shader to handle the opacity map of the drilled portions of the \"tooth\". Most of my efforts with the shaders were spent with the toon shader and the appropriate edge detection for it.

Since we were pressed for time and since there were very few entities, we resorted to simple collision detection with OBBs (Oriented Bounding Boxes) and the separating axis theorem.
