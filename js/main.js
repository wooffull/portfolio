The overworld is inspired by Super Mario World where the player can beat levels in different ways to unlock different paths.",

We wrote some fun shaders for this assignment, like bloom, a toon shader, chromatic aberration, edge detection, and a neat CRT TV-looking shader with a scan line. We also used a compute shader to handle the opacity map of the drilled portions of the \"tooth\". Most of my efforts with the shaders were spent with the toon shader and the appropriate edge detection for it. I was the project lead for this game as I planned out the development timeline, scheduled meetings, and ensured that our scope was manageable. I worked together with the programming lead to create the engine after we planned out its design.",

It really adds an atmosphere, especially compared to a plain white background. We implemented an oct-tree for spatial partitioning, but we had issues using it successfully for collision detection. Since we were pressed for time and since there were very few entities, we resorted to simple collision detection with OBBs (Oriented Bounding Boxes) and the separating axis theorem. Also, I wish we could have added basic animation so the character didn't look so rigid, but alas that was out of our scope.",

Modern, casual rhythm games like the Rhythm Heaven series introduced a new spin to rhythm gaming that mirrored Wario Ware minigames, and I wanted to be able to create rhythm games as unique as those.",
